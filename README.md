# ‚ú® üê¥ üî• PONITA-JAX

This is first go at a JAX implementation of Ponita and is not thoroughly tested, in fact, it is very much hacked into something that seems to reproduce the QM9 results. The repo contains two implementations, one based dense tensors in which (fully connected) graphs are padded to a fixed size and a mask is used to identify the nodes and a standard message passing approach based on a scatter operator. The former can be jitted, the latter cannot‚Äî-at least not in it's current form, but perhaps [jraph](https://github.com/google-deepmind/jraph) provides a solution. 

See [the original github repo](https://github.com/ebekkers/ponita) for a [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation. The original repo has more features than this one. The current repository is a minimal dependency implementation that currently only implements the fiber bundle method. Moreover, the dataloaders do not rely on PyTorch Geometric, but provide the same type of objects (graphs consisting of the tensors: x, pos, edge_index, batch).
